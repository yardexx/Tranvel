Simple Flutter application for searching train connections. Also informs about incidents and delays. 

Created as project in free time, now available for anyone to take a look.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository...

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yardexx/tranvel.git
```

... change directory to project ...

```shell
cd tranvel
```

... and run application.

```

## State management

At first, Provider pattern was used. Right now, application relies on bloc pattern.

### Why bloc?

* better separation of concerns

* it plays nice with repository pattern

* future possibility of state persistence (Hydrated Bloc)

## Roadmap

* Search train connection (wip)

* Fake API repository

* State persistence

* Ride history

* Incidents

* Simple profile

* Onboarding

## Ideas

* Fake ticket buying

* Real API
