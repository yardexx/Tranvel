## Tickets API
[![style: very good analysis][style_shield]][style_link]

## Overview
This package provides provides wrapper around `floor` package. Manages all kinds of stuff around 
DB and provides public API to access data.

`floor` uses `sqlflite` under the hood.

## Why?
Separation of concerns. Just to separate "database stuff" from "actual app" stuff. 

## Models
Description of models chronologically.

### ticket
Ticket with (for now autogenerated) id, date, price and `Train`. All stored as `String` thanks to
json serialization (umm... yeah, not optimal).

## Other stuff
* data access object (aka dao)
* actual database and its generated code

## Idea list
Current idea list for improvement:
* tests (Umm... yeah (x2))
